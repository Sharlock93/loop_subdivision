# Loop Subdivision using Half Edge Data Structure
This is a simple implementation of the loop subdivision algorithm using half edge data structure.

# Compiling the code

Compiling the code should be pretty straight forward
a simple 
```bash
cl main.cpp -o main
```
should work but a `setup.bat` and `build.bat` file has been provided to make this a bit easier
`setup.bat` should be updated with he proper location of the `vcvarsx64` file that comes with visual studio
